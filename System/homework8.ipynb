    "# The Swing-Up Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework we will study a classic problem of swinging up a pendulum and keeping it balanced. In this problem, forces in the range $[-1,1]$ are applied to a cart with a pendulum on it. The episode ends if one of the boundaries is reached or the pendulum swings too fast. Otherwise, it just keeps going. You recieve a reward of 1 any time the pendulum is above horizontal. You recieve a negative cost if the episode ends becauseof hitting the boundary or swinging too fast.\n",
