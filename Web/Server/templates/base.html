                    Our team developed an inverted pendulum system that could be accessed over a computer network for use by students. The inverted pendulum is a common controls problem used in academia. This problem teaches students concepts of control loops, data filtering, and machine learning.

                <h1> What is an Inverted Pendulum? </h1>
                <p>
                    A vertical pendulum that is balanced via the base moving. <br>
                    Controlled movements are determined by measuring the position and speed of the pendulum and base.
